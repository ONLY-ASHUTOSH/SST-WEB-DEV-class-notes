      The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
      descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated
      from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over 14,000 years ago.
      The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts
      estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years
      ago, which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long
      association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
      individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that
      would be inadequate for other canids.
